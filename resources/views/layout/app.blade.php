                         for the accuracy and quality of the information that users may acquire. It is apparent that

                         users must exer- cise their own best judgment in relying on information obtained from the
                         Internet, including the Site. ViralSnare bears no responsibility for information or

                         ViralSnare’s express permis- sion, regardless of how inaccurate, unsuitable, oensive, or
                         illegal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ViralSnare reserves the right to, and may from time
                         to time, monitor any and all information transmitted or received through the Site for

                         consent to such monitoring and use. We further reserve the right at all times to remove any

                         adequately compensated by damages in an action at law. You therefore agree that, without
                         limiting ViralSnare’s rights and remedies at law, including without limitation upon the
                         right to seek damages for any such breach by you, ViralSnare shall further be entitled to

                         consenting by these Terms of Service to personal jurisdiction in California.</p>

                         activities by Licensor. Licensee shall not be responsible for any payments to Licensor for
                         revenue earned in connection with the Licensed Rights but not received by Licensee for any
                         reason (for example due to non-payment or where Licensee does not receive adequate reporting
                         so as to enable Licensee to assign revenue). Licensor may choose to be paid via PayPal,
                         paper check, or elec- tronic bank transfer (the “Payment Method”). Any electronic bank
                         transfer fees will be deducted from the Licensor’s Payment prior to send- ing. Licensor

                         payment (the “Payment Details’) via their preferred Payment Method. Licensor further
                         understands that Payments may be subject to Withholding Tax which will be paid on behalf of
                         Licensor to the appropriate Tax Authority.</p>
