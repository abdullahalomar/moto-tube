                <h5>Payment to Copyright holder for License</h5>
                <p>Licensee will pay to Licensor 50% of the net prot actually received from the Work (the
                    “Payment(s)”). Licensee shall process the Payment to Licensor within fteen (15) days after
                    the end of each month; however, if the amount owed Licensor is less than ve US dollars ($50
                    USD) in any given month, Licensee reserves the right to carry the Payment over until the
                    amount exceeds ve US dollars ($50 USD). If the amount never exceeds ve US dollars ($50 USD)
                    or if the Licensee ceases license acquisition operations, then no Payment will come due.
                    Licensee will have no obligation to make any Payments which are reasonably suspected by
                    Licensee, in its sole discretion, to have resulted from fraudulent, misleading or false
                    activities by Licensor. Licensee shall not be responsible for any payments to Licensor for
                    revenue earned in connection with the Licensed Rights but not received by Licensee for any
                    reason (for example due to non-payment or where Licensee does not receive adequate reporting
                    so as to enable Licensee to assign revenue). Licensor may choose to be paid via PayPal,
                    paper check, or elec- tronic bank transfer (the “Payment Method”). Any electronic bank
                    transfer fees will be deducted from the Licensor’s Payment prior to send- ing. Licensor
                    agrees to provide Licensee all the necessary and accurate information required to process
                    payment (the “Payment Details’) via their preferred Payment Method. Licensor further
                    understands that Payments may be subject to Withholding Tax which will be paid on behalf of
                    Licensor to the appropriate Tax Authority.</p>
